I am a Physics PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania, currently working on CMB lensing reconstruction. I am part of the [Atacama Cosmology Telescope](https://act.princeton.edu/) collaboration and the [Simons Observatory](https://simonsobservatory.org/) collaboration. 
At the beginning of my PhD, I worked on testing and characterizing the Simons Observatory Large Aperture Telescope Receiver (LATR). For the past two years, I have transitioned into CMB lensing analysis work.
One of my recent projects aimed to reconstruct the matter power spectrum using CMB lensing and cosmic shear data, motivated by the S8 tension that has been observed between cosmological probes for the growth of structure from the early universe (e.g. CMB lensing) and the late universe (e.g. cosmic shear).
I am currently working on performing lensing reconstruction with the initial observations from Simons Observatory.
